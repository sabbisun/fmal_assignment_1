/**
* This class reads S, the stack-based intermediate code from stdin, interprets it and executes it "on-the-fly".
* Result is written to standard output.
* The main program of the Interpreter should correspond to the general function of an interpreter, i.e. the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
* If the Interpreter encounters an invalid operator, or if there are not sufficiently many arguments
* for an operator on the stack, then it should write out the error message: “Error for operator: nameOfOperator”
* (where nameOfOperator is the operator in question) and immediately quit.

Use a Stack class to process the intermediate code and use a Map class to store the values of
identifiers.
